#   Unified Production Tracking System

##   Overview

This system is designed to integrate machines, employees (workers), and administrators in a unified platform to track machine activity, monitor employee performance, and provide analytics through RFID technology. [cite: 1] The goal is to improve transparency, automate data collection, and optimize production efficiency. [cite: 2]

##   System Actors

###   2.1   Machine

Machines are physical workstations integrated with RFID and sensor modules to track: [cite: 3]

* Assigned user (employee)
* Associated devices (e.g., cloth bundle)
* Target vs. actual progress
* Real-time activity and status
* Feedback to employee (via light indicators)

###   2.2   Admin

Administrators will have access to system configurations, analytics, and data management features. [cite: 3, 4] Their responsibilities include: [cite: 4]

1.  RFID Management: Issue, assign, and manage RFID cards to employees. [cite: 4]
2.  Target Setup: Assign machine-wise production targets. [cite: 4]
3.  Analytics Dashboard:
    * Machine Status Monitoring: Active/Idle/Error tracking [cite: 5]
    * Employee Work Rate: Hourly performance insights [cite: 5]
    * Production Analysis: Line-wise productivity metrics [cite: 5]
    * Alerts & Warnings: Triggered by underperformance or anomalies [cite: 5]
4.  Employee Management: Maintain and edit employee records. [cite: 5]
5.  Machine Layout Mapping: Maintain physical row and column positions for machine arrangement. [cite: 6]

###   2.3   Employee (Worker)

Employees will interact with the system through RFID and scanning interfaces: [cite: 7]

1.  RFID Scanning: Scan RFID at the machine to start and end a work session. [cite: 7]
2.  Feedback Reception: Receive real-time feedback (visual/light indicators) based on performance. [cite: 8]
3.  Bundle Scanning: Scan cloth bundles at the start and end of processing for traceability. [cite: 9]
